# RGB
This is a form which has three labels R, G and B, as well as three input fields for numbers' input. The use can input values ranging from 0 to 255 inside those input fields. The input needs to be checked and process the suitable exception if the input is not numeric or is some of the values does not fit the said range.
The said numbers represent the RGB color number. Under the labels and text fields there are two radio buttons- Blink and Random, as well as the Start button. By clicking the Start button, we activate the Timer which depending on radio button executes one of these operations:
If the chosen value is Blink, the color of the form should change from input color number to white color every 5 seconds.
If the chosen value is "Random", the color of the form should change from the input color number to some random color which is generated by the tic of the Timer, every 5 seconds.
